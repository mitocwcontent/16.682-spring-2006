description: 'This resource includes lecture slides with a teview/introduction of
  the basic "gates" that comprise the digital world: and, or, nor, xor, multiplexers,
  registers, latches, and flip-flops (in general what the 74 series of digital components
  can do). Maintain all material on a "single-bit" level at this point. Introduce
  the concept of truth tables for these elements; teach the ability to create their
  own truth-tables.'
