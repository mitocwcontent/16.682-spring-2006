| SES # | TOPICS | LECTURE DESCRIPTIONS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | (Re)Introduction to design ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/lect1)) | Course introduction and overview. A revisit of the design process and where new prototyping techniques fall within it. |
| 2 | Review of E&M ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/lect2)) | An expedited review of the main concepts of E&M relevant to prototyping electronics. Concepts of voltage, current, resistance, capacitance, and inductance and their major relations: V = IR, P = IV = I 2 R, I= CdV/dt, V = LdI/dt. |
| 3 | Discrete components ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/lect3)) |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Review of the primary discrete components (assume prior introduction in Unified): resistors, capacitors, inductors, and diodes. Review of first and second order systems created with passive components. Emphasis on voltage dividers and low-pass filters. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Review/introduction of amplifiers: emphasis on general equations to implement different types of circuits. {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| 4 | Discrete components: Transistors ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/lect4)) | Review/introduce transistors and their primary different types: NPN/PNP, MOSFETs. Emphasis on the general operation, primarily on their behavior as it affects the digital world, rather than transient behavior. |
| 5 | Power components ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/lect5)) |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Review general concepts of voltage and current supplies. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Understand the general operation and how to utilize: linear regulator, inductor based regulators, integrated switching regulators. {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| 6 | Digital components ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/lect6)) |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Review/introduction of the basic "gates" that comprise the digital world: and, or, nor, xor, multiplexers, registers, latches, and flip-flops (in general what the 74 series of digital components can do). Maintain all material on a "single-bit" level at this point. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Introduce the concept of truth tables for these elements; teach the ability to create their own truth-tables. {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| 7 | Digital thinking |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Introduce students to thinking in the digital world: bit/nibble/byte/word concepts, octal/decimal/hexadecimal systems, bitwise vs. byte wise operations, word operations, data types representation. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Concepts of stacks, queues, pointers, and memory operations. {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| 8 | Processors | General purpose processor architectures: processing unit, stack, program memory, data memory, peripherals, interfaces. |
| 9 | Interfacing digital and analog | Introduce concept of digital/analog conversion (both ways). Present large array of available hardware that can be interfaced to processors. |
| 10 | Schematics: Introduction |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Introduce the schematic capture program: creation of schematic with existing parts on a single page. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Part placement, net naming, component numbering, bill of materials, netlist creation. {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| 11 | Schematics: Parts |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Introduction to parts libraries: creation/management of components. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Component entry for schematic operations– pin creation, arrangement, naming. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Intro to the ability to simulate a circuit (talk about it only, will not simulate). {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| 12 | Schematics: Advanced tools | Development of more complex schematics: multiple pages, ports, buses, multiple channels. |
| 13 | Schematics: Finishing design | Explanation of board level annotation, netlisting, and reports. |
| 14 | What is a PCB? |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Introduction to all the parts of a PCB. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Surface mounts vs. through-hole components. Hole sizes, drills, and mounting holes: specifying for all layers. Annular rings, clearance, and thermal relieve. {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| 15 | PCB design: Basics | Creating the first PCB: board outline, grid setup, clearances setup, nets setup, the ratnest, part placement. |
| 16 | PCB design: Routing | Routing: manual routing – take care of noise, ground lines, power lines. Automatic routing: when to use it. |
| 17 | PCB design: Finishing | Error checking, plotting/printing, file output, manufacturing details. |
| 18 | Documentation | Guide students in the development of documentation which clearly describes the functionality of the avionics board, including correct use of timing diagrams, truth tables, ratings, and plots. |
| 19 | Assembly tips | Provide students with best methods to assemble (soldering techniques) a new PCB. |
| 20 | Testing and debugging PCB's |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Best methods to test and debug a prototype PCB: power check, critical net check, part matching, part sorting, assembly in stages. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} The first time you power up a new PCB: what to look for. {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| 21 | Complex embedded systems | Introduction of Complex Embedded Systems: high end processors, FPGA's, high-speed circuits, etc.
